This demo was constructed by Limp Ninja. We are a community
of several people among the inscrutable number who inhabit
the demo scene. We demo sceners are still divided into
tribes based on platforms and size disciplines, but these
tribes are rapidly becoming a single global creative force.

We cast this message into the compo. It is likely to
survive at least a week of shitposting on pouet.net into
the future, while our civilization is profoundly altered
and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed.

Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, some
–perhaps many– may have inhabited planets and demomaking
civilizations.

If one such civilization intercepts this demo and can
understand these recorded contents, here is our message:

This is a present from an irreverent demo group, a token of
our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our
thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive
our time, so we may live into yours. We hope someday,
having solved the problems we face, to join a community of
galactic demo scene. This record represents our hope and
our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome
universe.

Signed,

Not The President of the United States of America
