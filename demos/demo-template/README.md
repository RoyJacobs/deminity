# demo-template

This is a minimal template for a demo that makes sure that the required files are there. 
`demo-template` is intended to be a good start for creating a new demo. The idea is that
`demo-template` is copied into a new directory. 

A demo consists of at least:
 * `demo.json` which holds demo meta-data
 * an `assets` directory
 * `post/post.json` with settings for post-processing
 * an `animations` directiory
